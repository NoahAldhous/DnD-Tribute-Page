        <h2> WHAT IS D&D?</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info">
        Dungeons and Dragons is a Fantasy Role Playing Game in which one or more players explore magical worlds, seek treasure, and fight monsters, communicating their actions to the Dungeon Master, or DM, who acts as an adjudicator of the rules, a guide for the players, and a generator of the world and its inhabitants.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
Tradtionally, the game is played using a technique known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1AEmkJpeg" target="_blank">theatre of the mind</a> to simulate combat, exploration and all other actions in the minds of the players- a <a href="https://dnd5echaractersheet.com/" target="_blank">
            character sheet</a>
            is used to keep track of equipment, spells, hit points, etc. and dice are rolled to resolve the outcomes of the players' actions.
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>
However, in a modern setting, it is common to use other tools and props in the game, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
        <li>Miniatures</li>
        <li>Battle Maps</li>
        <li>Digital Character Sheets</li>
        <li>Spell Cards
      </ul>
      </p>
     
          <div>
            <h2>ORIGIN</h2> 
   <p>
     The Creation of Dungeons and Dragons is largely attributed to <a id="tribute-link" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax" target="_blank"> Gary Gygax</a> (pictured below) who, along with others at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSR,_Inc.#Tactical_Studies_Rules>" target="_blank"> Tactical Studies Rules,(TSR,INC)</a> developed the original ruleset, taking from Gary's Medieval warfare simulator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)" target="_blank">Chainmail</a>, which he had created two years prior.

   <h2> WHY I LOVE IT </h2>
      <p>
        Dungeons and Dragons is, for me, the perfect game, as it seamlessly combines two of my biggest interests- storytelling and nerding out over game mechanics!</p>
        <div>
         <p>
          Whilst I enjoy open world video games a lot, the moment you reach the edge of the map, or try to do something that the mechanics don't allow for, there is always this moment where the illusion of freedom is suddenly shattered, and the limitations become apparent. Dungeons and Dragons is much better at simulating a practically infinite open world, and accounts for a much, much wider array of player choices. </p>
           <div>
             <p>Want to sail off into the horizon? You can! And what's more, there's most likely something cool (guarded by something that wants to kill you) out there! Want to talk to the local farmer? You can! And you have more than three dialogue options to choose from- you can say ANYTHING to them. 
             </p>
